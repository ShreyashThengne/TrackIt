commands:
trackit init
trackit hash_file
trackit cat_file
trackit write_tree

For hashing: The file is converted into binary and then header is added, which includes file type and file storage size. The hash is found using sha1.
Also, the headed file is compressed using zlib
If using cat_file without mentioning any id, then we would get all the files present in the hash

Tree: We have build a tree as well. This would contain type, oid, name in this sequence. Also, a tree can contain another tree as well, i.e. we can have a dir inside another.
We use recursion for that. At last writ_tree would return an oid for curr tree

Also added the suport for .trackitignore, which is similar to .gitignore

write_tree: This command would create a tree branch. Whose o_id has to saved somewhere and can be used to get back to that version of the files.
